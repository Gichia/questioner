# Questioner
This is an application that crowd-sources question suggestions for meet-ups.


# Summary
Questioner is an online platform that allows users to crowd-source interesting question suggestions for meetups posted on the site. The Admin creates and posts meetups, and then registered users can post questions they think can be interesting or beneficial to be discussed on a particular meetup.

The platform allows the meetup organizer to prioritize the questions to be aked or tackled during a meetup that he/she posted by going through the suggested question posted by users. A user is able vote on the asked questions suggested by other users, and as they do so, the questions bubble to the top or bottom of the log.
